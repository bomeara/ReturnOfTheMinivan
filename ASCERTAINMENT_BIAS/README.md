Note about tree file — it is not pruned to match the number of taxa in the trait file. So be careful with that.

Note about trait file — The first column is the species name. Second column is the temperate vs. tropical designations. If it has a 0 then all occurrences are temperate. If it has a 1, then all occurrences are tropical. Anywhere between 0 and 1 are the proportion of occurrences that in tropical. So, if a species has a 0.134, that means 13% of the occurrences are tropics, whereas 87% are in temperate.
